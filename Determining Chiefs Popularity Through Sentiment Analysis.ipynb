    "Read in or create a data frame with at least one column of text to be analyzed.  This could be the text you used previously or new text. Based on the context of your dataset and the question you want to answer, identify at what processing you think is necessary (stop words, stemming, custom replacement, etc.) Compare the feature space before and after your processing.\n",

    "### Project Background and Purpose\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to gather insight on the popularity of The Kansas City Chiefs during the preseason, and to use this information to predict attendance at future games. This project will provide value to the KC Chiefs' organization by benchmarking their current popularity and allowing them the opportunity to set targets for improving their fanbase's satisfaction at games. An example of improving fan satisfaction at Arrowhead Stadium is by giving away memorabilia. In contrast, if the Chiefs organization notices that their fan's satisfaction is trending in a positive direction and is predicted to continue trending in a similar manner, they might choose to give out less free-merchandise at games. Twitter will be the first method used to determine popularity then other methods can be added to predict on a better sample from various media sites such as YouTube API, Facebook API, and Google Search API.

This object was also chosen because it will likely provide insightful text that can be used to determine the underlying sentiment of a user towards the Chiefs. \n",
    "* The next two tweet objects that I chose to include in my data frame were the retweet and favorite counts for tweets including '#Chiefs' in their tags. Retweet and favorite counts can be useful when analyzing popularity of a tweet and will likely require different weights if a user is favoriting tweets more often than retweeting. \n",

Because of the prevalence of these kinds of tweets, and the fact that tweets are very brief by nature, there will not be a \"neutral buffer zone\" for sentiment labeling.

Upon inspection, I found that there are many words commonly used in the world of football that may or may not have sentiment, but may be seen as negative or neutral words in the dicitonaries. Some of these concerns were quelled when I found that words such as \"against\" and \"division\" are not included in the sentiment dicitonaries- these were commonly found in the Tweet text in a football context. There was one tweet that gave praise to the number of touchdown passes by the Chiefs quarterback, while claiming that the Chiefs defense was bad. While this tweet should be labeled as neutral or even positive, it was labeled as negative due the the word \"bad\" being in it, and \"touchdown\" having no sentiment attached to it. I am going to use a custom dictionary to replace \"touchdown\" and \"TD\" with \"success\" so that the dictionaries will register those words as positive. \n",
